Patch to jqlot's highlighter plugin to support arbitrary strings on highlight tooltips.

This patch implements the work done by Chris Folger on an older version of the plugin:

ALso includes a workaround for a bug in jqplot that breaks tooltips on plots with 
null points.

Patch is against jqplot 1.0.0b2_r792.
